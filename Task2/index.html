           UEFA Champions Leagues, and the UEFA European Championship. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183)

         <h3>HISTORY & ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>
         <p2>Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003,
             aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier 
             League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or.
              Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real 
              Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La 
              Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer.
               He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three 
               times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth
                an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player
                 over 30 years old.He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppe Italiana, and a Coppa Italia,
             before returning to Manchester United in 2021.</p2>
